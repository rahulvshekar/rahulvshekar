### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a driven 4th year BE CSE student exploring different technologies and projects to widen my skills.

- [Note-fy](https://github.com/rahulvshekar/note-fy) is an iOS Application that will detect denominations of Indian currencies using an ML model that I trained and read it out loud. It can be used by people who are visually impaired.
- [My Website](https://rahulvshekar.com) was made using pure HTML and CSS. The design was inspired by GitHub's markdown CSS. The website uses CSS media queries to support dark and light modes with different color themes. It uses media queries to also adjust for various screen sizes and be responsive. The website is packaged and deployed to be hosted on surge.sh, a CLI tool to host static websites. CloudFlare CDN is used to deliver the contents of the website and to provide an SSL certificate to serve the site over https.
- [Equipment Log](https://github.com/rahulvshekar/equipmentLog_firebase) is a web-based application that helps a company track the various devices and equipments it owns. It shows the entire list of devices and who currently possesses each of them and shows them as an activity log. It uses Firebase for its datastore.
