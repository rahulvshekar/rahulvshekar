### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a driven 4th year BE CSE student exploring different technologies and projects to widen my skills.

- [Note-fy](https://github.com/rahulvshekar/note-fy) is an iOS Application that will detect denominations of Indian currencies using an ML model that I trained and read it out loud. It can be used by people who are visually impaired.
- [Equipment Log](https://github.com/rahulvshekar/equipmentLog_firebase) is a web-based application that helps a company track the various devices and equipments it owns. It shows the entire list of devices and who currently possesses each of them and shows them as an activity log. It uses Firebase for its datastore.
